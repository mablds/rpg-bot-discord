# rpg-bot-discord

Discord bot created to manage RPG's character while play in discord servers.

## Usage
You can use the bot as it is by adding it to your own Discord's server. You can do this by using [this URL](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=705550811991769089&permissions=8&scope=bot) or pasting this on your browser:

```https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=705550811991769089&permissions=8&scope=bot```

After this, you only need to follow the steps. (You will need to be logged on your account at the discordapp website.) Or, you can use my code to create your new Bot with new functionalities or delete some of them. Feel free!

**Pull requestes are welcome.**
